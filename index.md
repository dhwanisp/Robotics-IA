## üß† Focus Areas

I design and support systems across the following domains:

- **Industrial Control & Automation**  
  PLC programming (IEC 61131-3), structured routines, interlocks, PID control

- **HMI & SCADA Systems**  
  Operator interface design, alarm management, tag-based communication, remote monitoring

- **Electrical Engineering & Power Systems**  
  Control panel drafting, MCC layout, VFD integration, protection and switchgear design

- **Robotics & Motion Simulation**  
  Offline programming, PLC-robot interfacing, I/O mapping, TCP configuration

- **Diagnostics, Simulation & Safety**  
  Emulator-based testing, safety relays, fault response, latching alarms
