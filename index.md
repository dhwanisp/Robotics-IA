# ‚ö° Dhwani Patel | Electrical & Automation Engineer

Welcome to my engineering portfolio ‚Äî where **electrical system design** meets **industrial automation** and **robotics integration**.

I‚Äôm an Electrical and Automation Engineer with hands-on experience in designing, supporting, and validating systems that power industrial processes. My background spans **control panel drafting**, **power distribution**, **motor control systems**, and growing expertise in **PLC/HMI programming** and **robot-assisted automation**.

This site documents my technical journey through simulation-ready projects, structured learning, and real-world integration practices.
