# 📂 Projects

This page showcases simulation-ready and design-verified projects across **electrical systems**, **PLC-based automation**, **HMI/SCADA development**, and **robotic integration**.

Each project documents structured logic, HMI visuals, CAD schematics, and emulator-based testing — using real-world industrial platforms.

## ✅ Featured Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [🚧 Project 2: Pump Control System with PID & Alarm Handling](projects/Project02_PumpControl/index.md) |  *A complete control logic system simulating a tank-based flow process. Includes dual-mode control (Manual + PID Auto), alarm latching logic, analog signal scaling (4–20 mA), and modular Studio 5000 routines. Fully emulator-compatible.* |

| 🚧 Project C | *(Coming Soon)* |
| 🚧 Project D | *(Coming Soon)* |

> More projects will be added as my learning roadmap progresses.
