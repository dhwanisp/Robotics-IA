# 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm **Dhwani Patel**, an Electrical and Automation Engineer based in **Kitchener, Ontario**, with hands-on experience in designing, supporting, and validating industrial control systems. My work spans **electrical panel design**, **PLC-HMI systems**, **robotic integration**, and **power systems** — supported by formal training and simulator-driven project development.

With experience across India and Canada, I approach every project with a focus on **safety, compliance, and scalable design** — whether it’s MCC layouts, control logic, or SCADA integration.
